# Make-Your-Own-Object-Detector
# Introduction
  The OpenCV library provides us a greatly interesting demonstration for a face detection. <br>
  Furthermore, it provides us programs (or functions) that they used to train classifiers for their face detection system, <br>
  called HaarTraining, so that we can create our own object classifiers using these functions.<br>
  
  Use the CascadeClassifier class to detect objects in a video stream. <br>
